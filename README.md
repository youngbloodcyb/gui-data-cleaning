# gui-data-cleaning

This is an extremely simple program I wrote to play around with making a simple GUI in Python.

I used the library PySimpleGUI alongside pandas to make a program that cleaned a CSV file of contacts. My coworkers and I used it in my previous job to easily clean large files of contacts for clients.

Eventually, we communicated our needs to our dev team offshores and they fixed the contact format within the system, making my simple program obsolete. Regardless, it was a fun project that helped add value for a while and allowed me to play around with simple GUIs in Python! :)
